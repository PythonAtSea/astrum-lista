# Astrum Lista

Astrum Lista (or just Lista) is a client for a couple NASA's public APIs. Right now it has support for the NASA Image and Video Libary as well as NASA Asteroids - Near Earth Object Web Service. I'm hoping to add the Astronomy Picture of The Day (APOD), but that's not runnig right now (yay governement shutdown!)

## Running Locally

Firstly, ya gotta start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, it'll be hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), assuming everything is set to the defaults. It's just a basic [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) project, not too hard to figure out. You can DM me on the Hack Club Slack @pythonatsea if you have any questions.
